# AxialTransformer-Replication
AxialTransformer-Replication is a faithful, paper-aligned reimplementation of the Axial Transformer architecture for autoregressive modeling on 2D data. The project directly translates the original mathematical formulation, block structure, and causal masking strategy into modular, readable code without architectural shortcuts.
